# Mapping the Journal des Dames et des Modes Napkin Exercise

## Map Layout

This plan includes a pop-up window that would appear over the 1797 map when the user clicked on the "Mapping" section of the home page. This overlay would include a short description of our section, including information about Paris' fashionable spots and the locations on the map showing where the journal was produced and sold. This overlay would then disappear if the user clicks either the "x" at the top right or on the map behind. The user can also pull up this intro page again by clicking "About" in the upper right corner.

In the main view, the 1797 map will be overlaid with hotspots showing these locations. The hotspots are different colors and/or shapes to indicate the several different categories (fashionable spots, JDM offices, JDM printers, JDM vendors). Toggle buttons at the top of the map allow the user to isolate one element of the map or see all spots at once.

The third element of our map is the pop-up windows that appear when users click the hotspots. A small window includes short text about the location, an image (if applicable), as well as a link to related JDM plates.
