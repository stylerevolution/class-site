## Homepage

![Image of Homepage](file:///Users/akar/Downloads/IMG_5650.JPG)

For the homepage I would like to have the title of the page in the middle, I would like to use the type of caligrafi in my drawin because I feel it looks more french but I could also eb open to the idea of using Bold font because it looks more editorial. 
In the right upper corner I would like to add social media bottons to make i look really modern and for people to share it more easyly on line without having to copy and past the link. 
In the big pox in the lest I would like to have the definition of the project and in the little boxes in the right I would to have the individual project in display by showing moving images and everytime you but the mouse over a box you can see the name of each project. 
And if you scroll down I would like to see the authors of the project and maybe the institution just to feel that our page is still an academic project. 


## Mapping Project

For the individyal project I would like to have in the  left upper corner a square that can retake uou to the main menu and on the upper left corner the same social media links. 
Then I would like to have the name of the indivudual project in the same font as the main project but a little bit smaller just so that the audence can unersand that this is just a small portion of a bigger project. 
For the map I want to have it in the left, taking the first two collums and on the right I want some squares were the aduence can see the description and erelevance for our project and also were they can see other projects that may directly connect with the map such as the colours and fabrics or others. I dont know if this is irrelebant but I think that we maigh also want to consider havinga section for notable women, just so that the audience can better understand who was an icon at that time and why.
Finally in the lover left side I would like to have a small section were the audience can see the authors of the project.

For the idividual par I would like to have the map in the left, still, so that there is not a lot of movement and the audience wont get dizzy. 
And as soon as you click on a place in the map I want the image to popo out to the right so that you can still have the map in case you want to see other images but you have a bigger picture n the right. 
Finally I want the map to become slightly smaller in case people want to learn more about the plate. By clicking in the plate I would like it to link to the translations and original text or some fun facts about the plate or place.  

Additionaly, I would like to have a light blue in all the pages with a stronger blue if needed I think that coulurs look good on fashion pages. Maybe in the background, I know that a lot of colours can make the page seen as a little too much but I think that if we use a light blue we can remember the audience with the connection to columbia as well as a more polished and chic site.
