## Homepage

![Image of Homepage]()

For the homepage I would like to have the title of the page in the middle, I would like to use the type of caligrafi in my drawin because I feel it looks more french but I could also eb open to the idea of using Bold font because it looks more editorial. 
In the right upper corner I would like to add social media bottons to make i look really modern and for people to share it more easyly on line without having to copy and past the link. 
In the big pox in the lest I would like to have the definition of the project and in the little boxes in the right I would to have the individual project in display by showing moving images and everytime you but the mouse over a box you can see the name of each project. 
And if you scroll down I would like to see the authors of the project and maybe the institution just to feel that our page is still an academic project.

Additionaly, I would like to have a light blue in all the pages with a stronger blue if needed I think that coulurs look good on fashion pages.
