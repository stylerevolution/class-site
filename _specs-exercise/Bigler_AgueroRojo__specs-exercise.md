# **Defining our project**
## *Mapping Places of Fashionable Sociability in Revolutionary France*

By mapping the fashion hotspots mentioned on the Journal des Dames et des Modes plates, this project will visualize the spaces of fashionable sociability in Paris during this radical style revolution. Despite the Journal’s attempts to legitimize the fashions presented by citing specific dates and locations, we will question whether these looks presented in the Journal were meant to record reality or to posit fanciful sartorial suggestions to women. Sometimes it is really hard to distinguish what is real and what is an imaginary or fantasy suggestion, especially in the fashion world. Even today we can look at some magazine editorials or catwalks and see an outfit that is “crazy” and “no one will ever wear that in real life” but when we look at outfits in a magazine from more than 300 years ago, when there was no photography, identifying if a street style of that outfit becomes problematic. In addition, understanding the  that is why, for our final project we wanted to create a visual representation for the spectator of how the outfits shown in the Journal des dames et des modes plates were worn in Paris´ streetstyle. By doing this, we intent to This map will explore the relationships between revolutionary fashion and real life in a way that will shed new light on the radical fashions of this period as well as the Parisian urban experience during the Revolutionary period. contextualize fashion in real life and discover some major secrets that can help us understand what was it like to live in Paris after the French Revolution. 

# **My part of the project (Ana Karen)**
For my share in the project, I will photoshop the figures in the plates 58 until 73 to the actual location where they were supposedly spotted. The places in the background will be taken from the period that the plate was made to create more accuracy.  I will also try to photoshop other people in the background to contextualize what was the general public´s reaction and dress code like. Finally, this images will be part of the map and will pop-up, depending on where in the map you click-on.

## **Weekly Agenda (Ana Karen)** 


Week | Date | Goal
------| ------ |---------
Week 7 |October 23 | Learn how to use photoshop and start translating most of my plates this week, a minimum of 10.Depending on the images that Sarah is able to find I´m going to start working on photoshop in at least 2 places.
------| ------ |---------
Week 8 | October 30 |Meet with Alex to see what else I can do to help with the mapping project finish the translation for my plates and edit 4 places.
------| ------ |---------
Week 9| November 6 |  Continue working with the images: Photoshop 6 places.
------| ------ |---------
Week 10| November 13 | Continue working with the images: Photoshop 6 places.

Week 11 | November 20 | Help with the integration of the project and help with the edition of the images.
------| ------ |---------
Week 12 | November 27 | Final Adjustments to the Map.

Week 13 |December 4 |Final Exposition





# **My part of the project (Sarah)**
I will be creating an interactive map of the fashion hot-spots cited on the plates of the Journal des Dames et des Modes. The map will use as its base the 1790 plan de P. Verniquet. I will mark the eighteen locations mentioned on the plates of the Journal. When users click on these marked locations a contemporary  image of the location will pop up. I have been researching the locations and compiling the contemporary images. I also hope to write an overview for the mark as well as perhaps a few sentences to accompany each location giving a brief summary of the location during this time period and its relationship to revolutionary fashion. 

## **My Weekly Agenda (Sarah)** 
Week | Date | Goal
------| ------ |---------
Week 7 |October 23 | Translate all my plates this week. Avery classics meeting on 23rd to view some more Vues de Paris, which may be better for Ana’s project than the ones from the Carnavalet. Confer with Emma about what other locations we are adding to the map for where the Journal was sold/read.
------| ------ |---------
Week 8 | October 30 | Meeting with Alex on the 30th to discuss the technologies necessary for building the map. Will have all images finalized by then. 
------| ------ |---------
Week 9| November 6 | Work on map: set-up, configuring etc.
------| ------ |---------
Week 10| November 13 | Work on map: add first half of the  locations. 
------| ------ |---------
Week 11 | November 20 | Work on map: adding second half of the locations.
------| ------ |---------
Week 12 | November 27 | Add all of Ana’s photoshoped images to the completed map.
------| ------ |---------
Week 13 |December 4 |Final Exposition

# **My part of the project (Emma)**
My contribution to the map project will involve attempting to map the production and distribution centers of the Journal des Dames et des Modes. Using the 1790 plan de P. Verniquet, I will mark the approximate locations listed in each issue of the JDM text, which include where one could subscribe to the journal (Chez Sellèque and Chez Dentu) as well as where it was printed (Imprimerie de Moller).  I hope to also include other locations listed by Kleinert that occur in JDM text we do not have access to, so that it may be possible to show how these locations changed over time. Because it is difficult to ascertain exact addresses on eighteenth-century maps such as those by Verniquet, I imagine it will be necessary to mark the appropriate location using something like a small transparent overlay circle. I would like these points to be clickable and provide text space for me to discuss the location, how Parisians may have accessed the JDM, and examples within the text where the journal is self-referential. 

## **My Weekly Agenda (Emma)** 
Week | Date | Goal
------| ------ |---------
Week 7 |October 23 | Look through available JDM text on Gallica to note all locations listed for journal offices and printers. Add locations to Sarah and Ana Karen’s list and mark their approximate locations on the period map.
------| ------ |---------
Week 8 | October 30 | Meet with Alex and Sarah about necessary skills for making interactive map.
------| ------ |---------
Week 9| November 6 | Work on map and determine what text/possible images are needed for pop-up informational overlays.
------| ------ |---------
Week 10| November 13 | Continue map work; have first half marked and have text written. 
------| ------ |---------
Week 11 | November 20 | Continue map work; add second half of my locations.
------| ------ |---------
Week 12 | November 27 | Final adjustments to hotspots and associated text.

Week 13 |December 4 |Final Exposition



# **Tasks to accomplish**
* Learn how to use Photoshopin order to create a visual representation to reconstruct the way in which outfits were spotted.(Reality vs. Fiction)
* Identify the locations listed on the plates 
* Research the locations of these specific sites
* Find a digitized map of Paris from the time period to use as the basis of the interactive map
* Track down contemporary images of these locations
* Figure out how to create the interactive map where these photoshopped images pop-up when you click/hover over them
* Write the accompanying text

# **What we expect to do/problems we expect to encounter**  
Since my research is already finished, I am more than halfway done with my part of the project. Now comes the difficult part of actually executing the map. I need to figure out what software is necessary as well as deal with issues surrounding acquiring the rights to use the map as well as the supplemental images that Ana Karen will edit. We will both need to learn how to create this type of photoshopped image as well. I also foresee us having some difficulties in exporting the map and putting it up onto the finished website. I think all the technical aspects of this project will require lots of assistance from Alex since I have no experience with this type of digital map-making. @agueroak for my share of the project I expect to hit some challenges in trying to insert other poeple in the plates as I need to match the same size so it looks proportioned. I am afraid that if I put a lot of images in the background some of the symbols and ideals that the plates represented will be lost.
