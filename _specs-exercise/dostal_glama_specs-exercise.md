### User Stories

For my project I want to compare and contrast British fashion plates with JDM fashion plates to determine the mutual influences and dissimilarities in fashion developments of both men and women's clothing from 1797-1804. I will also consider the history of cross-channel fashion exchange prior to the French Revolution and the effects of the Treaty of Amiens. 

### Desiderata

* Complete a survey of all available JDM text to find references to England and British fashion
* Visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Yale Center for British art to study two of the most popular British fashion magazines *Gallery of Fashion* and *Magazine of Female Fashions of London and Paris*
* Use digital databases and local libraries/archives to find plates from a variety of other British fashion magazines
* Potentially identify key caricatures, oil paintings, and/or other artworks to complement my primary material of fashion plates
* Come up with a (manageably sized! 5-8?) list of points of comparison (ie. specific hats, specific dress styles etc.)
* Using photoshop create a simple, visually appealing grid of these points of comparison so that when each item is selected it will lead to a second grid specific to that item with clickable images (fashion plates, portraits, caricatures etc.) that will each reveal more about the significance of that clothing item in London vs. Paris.

- [medium] As a [user], I want to [find a way to create a digital tool that can help me compare and contrast the political discourse on revolutionary clothing and fashion magazine rhetoric].
- [high] As a [user], I want to [create a dynamic timeline where I could compare and contrast plates from the *Journal des Dames et des Modes* and several other prints].

### Desiderata

- I need to define a precise body of primary sources, that could include, besides several plates from the JDM, some laws, decrees and pamphlets (which I could find in the recently digitalized pamphlet collection of the Newberry Library) and other prints, paintings and drawings pertaining to the official masculine revolutionary costume.
- I probably need to think about a glossary of technical terms used to define such costumes, to compare and contrast the language of clothing in political discourses and fashion magazines.
- I would like to look at the evolution of official masculine costumes, from David's project to Napoleon's uniform as Premier Consul, to see how and at what stage the influence of fashion is involved.

We have written our document together as a team project - "Bonaparteam" - for learning GitHub, but our actual class projects will be separate. However, we are in similar states of resesarch right now, and our next steps will be to go to archives, libraries and museums to find primary materials.
